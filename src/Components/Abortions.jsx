                    Having access to support during pregnancy can have a lasting impact on a person’s well being. As a full spectrum doula, I am trained to provide support for the full range of pregnancy outcomes, ​including abortion. My offerings include a variety of educational, physical, emotional, and spiritual forms of support. Whether it is a medicated or unmedicated birth, vaginal or cesarean, a miscarriage or an abortion, I would be honored to be part of your journey and I am here to support you wholeheartedly. My intention is for all people to feel safe, heard, and cared for throughout their journey.
